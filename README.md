# Service Discovery Server
Service Discovery is one of the key tenets of a microservice-based architecture.
In a cloudâ€‘based microservices application, we need a way of discovering the network location (IP and port) of a given service since both IP and port will most likely be assigned dynamically. Trying to hand-configure each client or some form of convention can be difficult to do and can be brittle.

A service registry is useful because it enables client-side load-balancing and decouples service providers from consumers without the need for DNS.
